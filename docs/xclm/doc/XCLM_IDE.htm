<h1>The XC License Manager (XCLM) in MPLAB X IDE</h1>
<hr>

<p>The Microchip Technology XC License Manager (XCLM) is a cross-platform license manager
for MPLAB® XC C compilers.</p>

<p>Some XCLM functions are supported in MPLAB X IDE.</p>

<h2>Using the XC License Manager (XCLM) to Roam</h2>
<p>
The XC License Manager (XCLM) supports a network license server/client setup.
You install a network license server and then check out client licenses.
See the installation documenation - "Installing and Licensing MPLAB<sup>©</sup> XC C Compilers"
(DS52059) - for details on how to install a network license server and connect clients.
</p>

<p>
As a Network client, you can checkout a network license that is active for up to 30 days
by using Roam Out. Reasons to roam out may be:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>You want to hold on to a license for several days.
  <li>You have a laptop and will not have a consistent connection to a network.
</ul>

<p>
The license server will check out and give a license to you.
The license server now has one less license of product that it can give out.
The license will stay checked out until you chose to Roam In or 30 days have passed.
</p>

<p>
In the MPLAB X IDE, you can easily roam your XC network license in or out.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Select <i><u>Tools>Licenses>Roam Network License</u></i> to open the
      Network License Management dialog (see image below).</li>
  <li>Click on the compiler that you wish to roam in or out.</li>
  <li>Click on either the "Roam in" or "Roam out" green arrows.</br>
      <b>Note:</b> When you roam in, there is a 60-minute delay before someone else can
      use your license.</li>
  <li>Click <b>Close</b> when you are done.</li>
</ol>

<p>
You can use roam in and roam out on the command line as well.
For details, see <a href="files/xclm_reference.htm">Command-Line Options Reference</a>.
